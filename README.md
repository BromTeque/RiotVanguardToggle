Toggles Riot Vanguard Anti-Cheat

RVT works by renaiming the Riot Vanguard Anti-Cheat file, "vgk.sys". This prevents the system from running the file at boot.

# FAQ

## Why do RVT need admin?
RVT needs admin to be able to rename the file.

## Riot Vanguard isn't installed on my C drive, what now?
You can easily change the Riot Vanguard directory by editing the batch file.

## Why is the release file named "word.exe"?
